# Simple Currency Exhange Web App

This is a a simple web app that shows the current exhcnage rates compared to the USD. It focuses on USD based news using the Yahoo Finance API. Fun fact, this project was the first project that I used an api with as well as giving tailwindcss a try. I never published it and back then I used a different version of NextJS. We can call this the third version of this app since the first was just using html, css, and javascript.

## Overview
A web application that grabs currency exchange rates comparing them against the US Dollar.
